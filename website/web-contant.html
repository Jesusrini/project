        <h2 style="color: blue;">The challenge</h2>
        <p>
        Facing steadily increasing competition in the market, one of the worlds largest pawn companies knew it needed to continue investing in its industry-leading customer experience. As part of that, the company wanted a solution that would increase customer engagement with retail associates in its 800 stores worldwide.
        </p>
        In addition, because the company does business in multiple territories, each with its own regulatory requirements and operational rules, it needed to update its legacy point-of-sale (POS) system into a scalable, microservices-focused solution.
        <h2 style="color: blue;"> customer experience </h2>
        <p>
        Using agile best practices, Cognizant Softvision created two “Virtual Pods” with team members located across the U.S., Argentina and Mexico and then leveraged a virtual workflow to build the client’s solution.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first Virtual Pod focused on modernizing the clients legacy back-end system. The second built the core solution—a tablet-based POS system designed to get retail associates out from behind counters and onto sales floors in the company’s stores. This total solution would drive a top-notch customer experience in the form of more personalized interactions and incremental sales.

                <p>
                    After a successful 25-store pilot, a global rollout was planned for 2020. Then an unforeseen roadblock emerged: the COVID-19 pandemic. As social distancing disrupted the company’s new in-store business model, Cognizant Softvision’s Virtual Pods nimbly pivoted and provided new features designed specifically to adapt to a remote environment.

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p> <br>
